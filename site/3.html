Our first lighthouses were actually given to us by Nature. Sailors sometimes used landmarks such as glowing volcanoes to guide them. In the Ancient World, trading ships were eventually built enabling navigators to sail long distances to buy and sell goods. In the days of wooden ships with sails, the wind and waves could easily push them against the rocks and wreck them. And so, the need for lighthouses as warning signals arose.

One of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World was a lighthouse—the famous Pharos of Alexandria, Egypt. It is the first one that is recorded in history and was built about 280 BC. Those records tell us that it was the tallest one ever built—450 ft. (comparable to a 45-story skyscraper) and used an open fire at the top as a source of light. This fantastic structure survived for 1500 years until it was completely destroyed by an earthquake in the 14th century.

Today we call people who study (or are interested in) lighthouses pharologists. The name comes from that famous lighthouse.

What is a lighthouse?

It is a tower with a bright light at the top, located at an important or dangerous place regarding navigation (travel over water). The two main purposes of a lighthouse are to serve as a navigational aid and to warn boats of dangerous areas. It is like a traffic sign on the sea.

Do all lighthouses look alike?

Although we often think of a lighthouse as a tall, white conical tower, there are many, many variations of design. Depending on its location, it might be tall (where the land was very flat) or short and squat (where there was a high cliff or rocky coast). It could be square, octagonal (with eight sides), conical (like an ice cream cone upside down), or cylindrical (like a very fat pipe).

When the lighthouses were built, they were constructed with whatever materials were most readily available. They were designed to fit the local geographic and climatic conditions. Some are made of stone; others brick, concrete, wood, steel, cast iron, and even tabby (a mixture of shells, lime, sand and water).

Where are lighthouses located?

The United States has several coastlines used by ships from around the world. In the East it borders the Atlantic Ocean, in the West the Pacific Ocean, and in the South the Gulf of Mexico. But we also have another very important area of coastline where the land meets the sea, the Great Lakes. All of these four areas bordering our country need and have lighthouses, as well as some of our more important navigable inland waterways. For example, the Hudson River, Lake Champlain, Chesapeake Bay and San Francisco Bay are also dotted with lighthouses.

How could one lighthouse be distinguished from another?

Years ago, to help the sailor determine his location, the Lighthouse Board (which was in charge of lighthouses from 1852–1910) issued an order to have each lighthouse painted in different colors and/or designs.

But what about night? You can't see colors or patterns at night, but you can see lights. However, unless there was some way to make each light different you could have the same problem. Early on, they built multiple lights (that is, two or three together.) This was one way to help the sailors at sea determine their location, but it was very expensive.

Mounting a group of lights on a rotating framework made it possible to produce a special pattern of light for each lighthouse. The rotating lights made a lighthouse look like it was flashing its light on and off. The invention of the Fresnel (pronounced “Frey Nel”) lens in 1822 was probably the most important discovery in lighting technology. As well as enabling man to produce an unlimited number of flashing combinations, it also intensified (brightened) the light so it could be seen at greater distances.

The Fresnel lens can be compared to a huge lampshade except that it is made of 100s of pieces of beautiful, specially cut glass. It surrounds the lamp bulb. This lens, due to its special design, brightens the glow from the light. It takes the rays of light, which normally scatter in all directions, and bends (refracts and reflects) them, focusing them into a single beam of light. Fresnel lenses are of two types: fixed, which shows a steady light; and revolving, which produces a flash.

The individual flashing pattern of each light is called its CHARACTERISTIC. For example a light can send out a flash every five seconds, or it might have a fifteen-second period of darkness and a three-second period of brightness. Mariners have to look at a light list or a maritime chart that tells what light flashes that particular pattern. Then they are able to determine their position at sea in relation to the land.

What happens in fog when the light isn't visible?

In situations like this there is another method of notifying the mariner, using sound. It is called a foghorn. The first one was used in 1719 at Boston light and it was, of all things, a cannon. Can you imagine being a lighthouse keeper and having to fire the cannon every hour when there was fog? During a long spell of fog you wouldn't get any sleep. Later they tried various other means of making a noise for warning. Fog bells were used as well as steam whistles and reed trumpets and sirens. The sounds they gave out were generally low-pitched and very mournful—almost like a wail. Each one emitted a specific number of blasts every minute so it could be told apart from all others. Today, an automatic sensor, which detects moisture in the air, turns on the fog signals when needed. There are also soundless fog signals called radio beacons (an electronic device).

These fog signals were not placed everywhere. Although some places experience no fog problems, fog-warning devices are very necessary m New England, on the Pacific Coast, and in Alaska.

When were the first lighthouses built in the U.S.?

In colonial times, before we became an independent nation, men realized the need for lighthouses at the major ports to help guide ships into the harbors, to prevent them from crashing, and thereby losing their precious cargoes. So, the first lighthouses were built by the colonies (which were called states after 1776).

Most lighthouses were named for their location, but several were named after ships that wrecked themselves nearby before a lighthouse was built. For example: Alligator Reefs, Pigeon Point, and Ship John Shoal. Others were named because of events that occurred there: Dead Man's Rock, Cape Disappointment, and Execution Rocks.

What were the duties of the lighthouse keepers?

Before the days of electricity, they had to light the lamp at sunset and extinguish it (put it out) at sunrise. During an 8-hour watch at night they had to climb the stairs in the tower one to three times a night to check on the lamp and wind the weights. Some lighthouses have as many as two hundred steps! The brass in the building had to be shined, and all the windows cleaned. Often it took a whole day to clean and polish the lens alone. It was very important to keep both the lens and the lantern room windows clean so the light would not be lessened in any way.

A daily log had to be kept detailing everything from the weather to the amount of fuel consumed. The Keeper also had to tend to the mechanism used to operate the fog signal. During the year many items had to be painted.

The men and women of the Lighthouse Service were among the most dedicated civil servants, often performing in extreme hardship. Abbie Burgess, while also caring for her family, served 38 years at the Matinicus Rock and White Head Light Stations in Maine. Keepers also saved lives. Ida Lewis rescued 18 people during her 39 years at the Lime Rock Lighthouse. Marcus Hanna, the keeper of the Cape Elizabeth Light, is the only man to have won the Medal of Honor and the Gold Lifesaving Medal. Other keepers died on duty. A 1906 hurricane, for instance, destroyed twenty-three lights along the Gulf Coast and killed the keepers at Horn Island and Sand Island. In 1946 a tsunami destroyed the Scotch Cap (Alaska) light and killed the entire crew.

What is happening to lighthouses at present?

Increased mechanization and improved technology have made keepers unnecessary. Today, all of the lighthouses in our country have been automated, except the one at Boston, which still has keepers, for sentimental reasons only. (Boston Light was the first one built on our shores.)

Many of the lighthouses are no longer needed due to advances in technology and they have been or are being turned over to various government agencies or non-profit local organizations to maintain and administer. It is important to keep them in good condition for future generations to learn about their place in the maritime history of our country. It is also a special experience to be able to climb the stairs just as the keepers did and picture what life was like in times past. They also need protection from vandalism and threats of erosion.

<section id="penguins">PENGUIN FACT SHEET
STATUS (U.S.):
The Galapagos penguin is listed as endangered
under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.
DESCRIPTION:
Penguins are flightless sea birds. They can be
many different colors from the chest up. Most
species have black backs and white fronts.
Penguins are able to control their body
temperature on land by facing either their black
back or white front to the sun. This coloration
also camouflages them in the water. They have
a thick layer of blubber that helps keep them
warm.
SIZE:
There are 17 penguin species, varying greatly in
size. The largest is the emperor penguin at 4
feet tall and about 65 to 90 pounds. The
smallest is the little penguin, also known as the
blue or fairy penguin, which weighs 2 pounds.
LIFESPAN:
Penguins can live up to 15 to 20 years in the
wild.
RANGE:
Penguins are found on every continent in the
southern hemisphere, from the Antarctic to the
Galapagos Islands.
FOOD:
Penguins are carnivores and mostly eat krill, a
tiny shrimp-like animal, and other fish. Their
sharp, spine-like teeth allow them to catch fish
up to 10 inches long, which they swallow head
first.
BEHAVIOR:
With compact, streamlined bodies, penguins can
swim an average of 2.5 to 5 miles per hour –
using their wings as paddles – with some species swimming as fast as 7.5 miles per hour. They also "toboggan," laying
on their belly and pushing themselves along the ice with their flippers and feet. Most penguin species spend several hours
a day preening and waterproofing their feathers with an oil produced from a gland located above their tail feathers.
Feathers are important to keep penguins warm and to keep cold water from touching their skin.
OFFSPRING:
Most penguin species gather in colonies in areas
free from land predators during nesting. Many
penguins build a nest of rocks, sticks or grass
where one or two eggs are laid. Because
penguins only eat in the ocean, they must fast
while mating, incubating eggs and guarding
chicks. The male and female usually take turns
tending to the eggs and raising the chicks while
the other mate returns to the ocean to eat. Adult
feathers replace a chick’s down at about two to
four months. Once the chick has adult feathers,
it is ready to swim and hunt on its own.
ANATOMY:
Penguins are superbly adapted to an aquatic life.
Their wings have become flippers, useless for
flight in the air. In the water, however, penguins
are astonishingly agile. Within the smooth plumage a layer of air is preserved, ensuring buoyancy. The air layer also helps
insulate the birds in cold waters. On land, penguins use their tails and wings to maintain balance for their upright stance.
All penguins have a white underside and a dark (mostly black) upperside. This is for camouflage. A predator looking up
from below (such as an orca or a leopard seal) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin belly and the
reflective water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above.
Diving penguins reach 6 to 12 km/h, though there are reports of velocities of 27 km/h (which are probably realistic in the
case of startled flight). The small penguins do not usually dive deep; they catch their prey near the surface in dives that
normally last only one or two minutes. Larger penguins can dive deep in case of need. Dives of the large Emperor
Penguin have been recorded which reach a depth of 565 m (1870 ft) and last up to 20 minutes.
Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow, a movement called "tobogganing", which
allows them to conserve energy and move relatively fast at the same time.
Penguins have an excellent sense of hearing. Their eyes are adapted for underwater vision, and are their primary means
of locating prey and avoiding predators; in air, conversely, they are nearsighted. Their sense of smell has not been
researched so far.
They are able to drink salt water safely because their supraorbital gland filters excess salt from the bloodstream. The salt
is excreted in a concentrated fluid from the nasal passages.
Penguins have no external genitalia.
THREATS:
Penguins living more than 60 degrees south of the equator are protected from hunting by the 1959 Antarctic Treaty.
Penguins are currently threatened by human activity. Threats include oil spills, human exploitation for guano and food,
entanglement in fishing gear, human encroachment, over-fishing of food sources and introduced predators such as dogs.
CAPTIVITY:
While zoos and aquariums may appear to be educational and conservation-oriented, most are designed with the needs
and desires of the visitors in mind, not the needs of the animals. Many animals in zoos and aquariums exhibit abnormal
behavior as a result of being deprived of their natural environments and social structures. Some zoos and aquariums do
rescue some animals and work to save endangered species, but most animals in zoos were either captured from the wild
or bred in captivity for the purpose of public display, not species protection. The vast majority of captive-bred animals will
never be returned to the wild. When the facility breeds too many animals they become "surplus" and often are sold to
laboratories, traveling shows, shooting ranches, or to private individuals who may be unqualified to care for them.
PROTECTION:
The Galapagos penguin is the only species listed as endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.
